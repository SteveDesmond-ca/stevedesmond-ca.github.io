A couple months ago, I published the initial production-ready release of [SimpleGPIO](https://github.com/stevedesmond-ca/SimpleGPIO/), my new .NET Standard OSS IoT library. Since then, I've been busy working on new features, which were included in two real-life projects I demo'd to a live audience last week.

I realize that the [extensive intro and proof-of-concept examples last time around](https://stevedesmond.ca/blog/introducing-simplegpio) didn't garner much attention, but I'm hoping that these real-world uses might pique more interest. So without further ado, check out what I built with SimpleGPIO 1.1!

As always, the goal is not just to write less code, but also clearer code. The source for both projects is available in [this repo](https://github.com/stevedesmond-ca/LittleExplorers), or if you'd like specifics on the new features, check out the [SimpleGPIO 1.1 Release Notes](https://github.com/stevedesmond-ca/SimpleGPIO/releases/tag/1.1.0).
