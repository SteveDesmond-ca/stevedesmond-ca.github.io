<p>Almost three years and two children later, I finally have a corner (literally) of the house to call my own. There are still some finishing touches to be done (currently no doors, etc) but it's enough to at least move into.</p>

<br />A before-and-after from the doorway, facing west</p>
<p><rimg base="IMG_9609" />
<br />The north wall and its many built-in panels: from power to fresh air to gigabit ethernet to 7.1 surround sound</p>
<p><rimg base="IMG_9610" />
<br />South wall, now with a frosted window so I don't need to look at the ugly under-side of our deck</p>
<p><rimg base="IMG_9607" />
<br />Facing east back toward the entrance, closet under the stairs on the left</p>
<p>As I tweeted, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't really proud of myself!</p>
