#### I gave a talk!

My very first talk, in fact, at a conference.  Last week, during [HighEdWeb NY](http://ny15.highedweb.org), I presented "There's an App for That: Creating Cross-Platform Native Experiences Using Open Web Standards" -- isn't that a mouthful!

You can read the full abstract [here](http://ny15.highedweb.org/schedule/theres-an-app-for-that-creating-cross-platform-native-experiences-using-open-web-standards/), but it's basically about using more advanced HTML5 / CSS / JS APIs to make your web apps as fancy as those new-fangled native ones.

Check out the slides in the [Talks](/talks) section of this site, or enjoy a recording of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9hmzH6-9bk).
