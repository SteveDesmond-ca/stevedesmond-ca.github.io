<h4>I gave a talk!</h4>
<p>My very first talk, in fact, at a conference.  Last week, during <a href="http://ny15.highedweb.org" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> HighEdWeb NY</a>, I presented "There's an App for That: Creating Cross-Platform Native Experiences Using Open Web Standards" -- isn't that a mouthful!</p>
<p>You can read the full abstract <a href="http://ny15.highedweb.org/schedule/theres-an-app-for-that-creating-cross-platform-native-experiences-using-open-web-standards/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> here</a>, but it's basically about using more advanced HTML5 / CSS / JS APIs to make your web apps as fancy as those new-fangled native ones.</p>
<p>You can check out the slides in the <a href="/talks"><i class="fa fa-comment"></i> Talks</a> section, or enjoy a recording of it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9hmzH6-9bk" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i> here</a>.</p>
